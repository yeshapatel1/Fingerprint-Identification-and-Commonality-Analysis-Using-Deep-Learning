# Fingerprint-Identification-and-Commonality-Analysis-Using-Deep-Learning

This project presents a research on biometric to classify fingerprints using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models like ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3. The goal is to achieve accurate and efficient fingerprint identification using a small dataset.

Objective
To build a deep learning-based fingerprint classification model that recognizes fingerprint patterns (arch, loop, whorl) with high accuracy.

Key Features
- Custom CNN model built from scratch
- Transfer learning using ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3
- Comparison of test accuracy across models
- Data augmentation to balance fingerprint categories
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

Dataset
- Fingerprint images from an academic dataset 3,360 images from 17 individuals collected via the MyFingerprint app.
- Preprocessing included resizing, normalization, and augmentation using techniques like flipping, rotation, and brightness tuning.
